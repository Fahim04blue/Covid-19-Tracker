# Covid-19 Tracker

[Live Site](https://covid-19-tracker-bd.web.app/)

This is a Covid-19 Tracker App I built using React.js . Some key aspects of the application :

* Show live cases, recoveries and deaths (Api used - https://disease.sh/docs/ ) on clickable tabs.
* Shows Global cases, recoveries and deaths and Country based cases, recoveries and deaths
* A line chart to show the fluctuation of cases over days (hoover to get see exact values)
* Clickable marker on map to show country based stats.
* Darkmode theme for user preference
