# Covid-19 Tracker

[Live Site](https://covid-19-tracker-bd.web.app/)

This is a Covid-19 Tracker App I built using React.js . Some key aspects of the application :

* A Global Covid-19 Tracker App (API used - https://disease.sh/docs/ ).
* Global and Country-based live cases, recoveries, and deaths (clickable 
tabs)
* Line chart to show the fluctuation of global cases, recoveries, and deaths 
over days (hoover to see the exact values)
* Clickable marker on the map to show country-based stats.
* Dark mode theme
